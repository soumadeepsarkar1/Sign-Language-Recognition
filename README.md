# Sign-Language-Recognition
This repository contains the sign language recognition project which I created during my final year in B.Tech.
American Sign Language Recognition system has been developed that can recognize signs in real time using video input from a camera. 
MediaPipe Holistic pipeline has been for landmark detection
Developed two models, one using GRU and the other using LSTM. Both the models achieved 99% accuracy.
Custom dataset built by recording videos using webcam.
