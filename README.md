# Sign-Language-Recognition
This repository contains the sign language recognition project which me and my group created during my final year in B.Tech.\
American Sign Language Recognition system has been developed that can recognize signs in real time using video input from a camera. \
MediaPipe Holistic pipeline has been for landmark detection.\
Developed two models, one using GRU and the other using LSTM. Both the models achieved 99% accuracy.\
Custom dataset built by recording videos using webcam.\
